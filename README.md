Instructions for simple autotyper:
1.  Install requirements (built on Python 3.10, but it should work with the latest Python and packages).
2.  Open Python and install the required libraries in python:
       `pip install pyautogui`
       `pip install pynput`
    (time should be pre-installed in the Python distribution)
3. Create a new text file (.txt) using notepad or a similar program. Separate typed items by new lines.
4. Edit the python script's file path on line 62 with the file path of your text file:
   `text_file = 'C:\Users\joelt\OneDrive\Documents.txt'`
5. Use the autotyper at any time and press `Esc` to stop it if you made a mistake.
